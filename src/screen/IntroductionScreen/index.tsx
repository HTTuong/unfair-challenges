                            In this challenge, the same user interface and logic have been made with
                            a few tiny differences. The above saved users will be showed in this
                            section. I also assume that this week is Week 1. You can see list of
                            available users by click through the options or filtering them by a
                            particular week. You should add more than two users to tinker and test
                            this challenge.
